# Extensions

Lynx can be extended with new hints or new specification properties. A new hint extension could be used to describe the meaning of a value more specifically than a [base hint](/#base-hint). A new specification property extension could be used to help a user agent improve a user's experience with a value. For example, it may describe a relationship between two values or it may describe an action that a user agent may take on behalf of a user.
