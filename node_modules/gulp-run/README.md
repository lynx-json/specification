gulp-run
==================================================
Use shell commands in your gulp or vinyl pipeline.

Many Unix commands are built around the idea of piping. Let's take advantage of that in our Gulp pipeline! This plugin is inspired by [gulp-shell] and [gulp-spawn] and attempts to improve upon their great work.


Usage
--------------------------------------------------

### `var run = require('gulp-run')`


API
--------------------------------------------------

### `var cmd = run(command, [options])`

Gets a through stream for a shell command to which you can pipe vinyl files. For each file piped, a new process is spawned, the file is read into the processes's stdin, and a file containing the processes's stdout is pushed.

Additionally, `./node_modules/.bin` is prepended to the PATH for the child process, so you have access to all the binaries provided by your module's dependencies.

### Arguments
1. `command` *(String)*: The command to run. It can be a [template] interpolating the vinyl file
    as the variable `file`.
2. `[options]` *(Object)*:
    - `env` *(Object)*: The environmental variables for the child process. Defaults to
        `process.env`. The path `node_modules/.bin` is automatically prepended to the PATH.
    - `cwd` *(String)*: The initial working directory for the child process. Defaults to
        `process.cwd()`.
    - `silent` *(Boolean)*: If true, do not print the command's output. This is the same as
        setting verbosity to 1. Defaults to `false`.
    - `verbosity` *(Number)*: Sets the verbosity level. Defaults to `2`.
        - `0` never outputs anything.
        - `1` outputs basic logs.
        - `2` outputs basic logs and the stdout of the child process.

#### Returns
*(Stream.Transform in Object Mode)*: The through stream you so desire.

#### Example
```javascript
gulp.task('even-lines', function () {
    gulp.src('path/to/input/*')            // Get input files.
        .pipe(run('awk "NR % 2 == 0"'))    // Use awk to extract the even lines.
        .pipe(gulp.dest('path/to/output')) // Profit.
})
```


### `cmd.exec([callback])`

Executes the command immediately, returning the output as a vinyl stream. Unless the `silent` option is true, the output is tee'd to `process.stdout` with each line prepended by the string **"[*title*] "** where *title* is the command's name.

The name of the file pushed down the pipe is the first word of the command. See [gulp-rename] if you need more flexibility.

#### Arguments
1. `[callback]` *(Function)*: Execution is asynchronous. The callback is called once the
    command's stdout has closed.

#### Returns
*(Stream.Readable in Object Mode)*: A stream containing exactly one vinyl file. The file's contents is the stdout stream of the command.

#### Example
```javascript
gulp.task('hello-world', function () {
    run('echo Hello World').exec() // prints "[echo] Hello World\n"
        .pipe(gulp.dest('output')) // Writes "Hello World\n" to output/echo
})
```
