# TODO List

- Ensure that we have a general statement about the rules of hint extension in terms of format and semantics. This came up during the documentation of of the `group` hint and whether or not we need to put a reference to `container` in its format section.
  - Ensure that we remove all of the redundant rules hints that extend another hint.
- Review `label` hint to be consistent with the `header` hint.
