# Specification Properties

A specification property is used to provide metadata for a JSON value. If a specification property is unqualified, it MUST be assumed to be in the `http://lynx-json.org/` namespace. For example, a specification property of `visibility` MUST be considered to be `http://lynx-json.org/visibility`.
