## Authoring Considerations

Use a `group` hint when the emphasis is more on the group than on the values in the group.

## User Agent Rules

None

## User Agent Considerations

In order to emphasize the group more than the values in the group, a user agent should render the group in a way that accomplishes that goal. For example, a user agent may choose to render the values in a group in the primary direction of reading order, such as left-to-right in English (as opposed to the secondary direction of reading order top-to-bottom).
